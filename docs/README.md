## Monax: [https://monax.io](https://monax.io)

**Dazza Greenwood explores Blackstone with Anjlee Khurana, Legal Engineer of Monax**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WjL4xYOXFFI?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

* Hackers Wiki Page: [https://github.com/mitmedialab/OpenMediaLegalHack/wiki/How-to-Use-Monax
](https://github.com/mitmedialab/OpenMediaLegalHack/wiki/How-to-Use-Monax) (We encourage the Monax team and others to add useful links and tips to this page) 

> Monax, a leader in open-source blockchain technology, recently released [the Blackstone project](https://github.com/agreements-network/blackstone) which comprises a business process engine written entirely in Solidity smart contract language as well as a high-level RESTful API. This extensive release includes over 19,000 lines of solidity code, including a BPM engine and 13,000 lines of documentation. Blackstone is the culmination of four years of work focused on advancing blockchain technology for businesses.   Happy building! 

> For a more detailed discussion on the components of the Monax stack, of which the BPM is at the centre, see this recent [blog post](https://monax.io/blog/2018/09/20/the-monax-stack-what-makes-legal-products-go./). To dive in further, [this blog](https://monax.io/blog/2018/08/21/example-active-agreement-workflows-and-interfaces/) gives a working diagrammed example of a business process model for a sale of goods contract workflow. We have also written extensively on combining BPM and blockchain tech in a recent Hyperledger [guest blog](https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2018/08/16/business-process-modeling-the-missing-link-between-legal-know-how-and-blockchain-based-legal-products).  For more information on Blackstone, check out [this announcement](https://monax.io/blog/2018/09/25/introducing-the-monax-bpmn-engine---the-powerhouse-for-legal-products./).

> Anjlee is Monax's Legal Engineer, working alongside our CCO on the Legal Engineering team. She's responsible for product-market fit and a range of other areas on the LE side of things. Before joining Monax, Anjlee spent over a decade as an entertainment attorney, representing clients at both ends of the spectrum: from high-profile celebrities to those attempting new business models to save a rapidly shrinking industry. In addition, she volunteers her time to support artist-related causes.

**Dazza Greenwood explores OpenLaw with Michael Chan of ConsenSys**

* Hackers Wiki Page: [https://github.com/mitmedialab/OpenMediaLegalHack/wiki/How-To-Use-OpenLaw](https://github.com/mitmedialab/OpenMediaLegalHack/wiki/How-To-Use-OpenLaw) (We encourage the OpenLaw team and others to add useful links and tips to this page) 

> With these OpenLaw tools by ConsenSys, Artists now have a way to issue content licenses, split and sell ownership rights automatically, without any central authority/or centralized cloud computing platforms.

> In the demo, an Artist can upload a piece of digital art and create an NFT.  Once, the NFT is created, an Artist can subdivide the NFT into any number of ownership and/or licenses out of the NFT.  These licenses are then purchased through an OpenLaw powered agreement.  Using the OpenLaw smart contracts, we can model out automatically enforceable property rights, royalty payments, licensing, resale rights, etc.

> The technical documentation is still being built out, but OpenLaw has their testnet available now at: [https://openlaw.io](https://openlaw.io).  OpenLaw also has quite a bit of writing on it on their Medium page here: [https://medium.com/@OpenLawOfficial](https://medium.com/@OpenLawOfficial).

## The Accord Project: [https://www.accordproject.org](https://www.accordproject.org)**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4prDSsJiMUE?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The best place to look for AP tools and examples would be the [template library](https://templates.accordproject.org/) and the [data model repository](https://models.accordproject.org).   

In terms of tools, as was discussed in the most recent Tech working group call (every Wed at 4pm EST see cal [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=accordproject.org_gktijdpnstaltatqcv6bcvr54o%40group.calendar.google.com)), we're developing an online template studio. See [here](https://deploy-preview-15--template-studio.netlify.com/) and [https://github.com/accordproject/template-studio](https://github.com/accordproject/template-studio).

We also have a video from earlier this year giving an overview of AP technology here: [https://youtu.be/4prDSsJiMUE](https://youtu.be/4prDSsJiMUE).
